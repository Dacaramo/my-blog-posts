## What Next.js currently allows

Out of the box with Next.js you can have development and production environments. But if you need more than that you're stuck. In order to configure the env variables for each of those environments you need to create the following 2 files at the root of your project (outside the `/app` folder):

- `.env.development` for the development environment
- `.env.production` for the production environment

The env variables values inside `.env.development` will be used when running the app with the `next dev` command.

The env variables values inside `.env.production` will be used when running the app with the `next start` command.

> If in addition you use the `.env.local` file then all of the env variables will be pulled from this specific file instead.

## How to have as many environments as you want

Let's say we want dev (development), stag (staging) and prod (production) environments.

First, create at the root of your project (outside the `/app` folder) a folder named `/env`. Inside `/env` create the following files:

- `.env.dev` for putting your dev environment variables
- `.env.stag` for putting your stag environment variables
- `.env.prod` for putting your prod environment variables

Add env variables to your `.env.dev`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:9000
SECRET_API_KEY=my-development-secret-key
```

Add env variables to your `.env.stag`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://www.staging.myapi.com/api
SECRET_API_KEY=my-staging-secret-key
```

Add env variables to your `.env.prod`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://www.production.myapi.com/api
SECRET_API_KEY=my-production-secret-key
```

Remember that all of the variables that are preceded by the `NEXT_PUBLIC` prefix are available on you app bundle, they will be available to use on the client. That's nice, but only for variables that are not secrets. On the previous code samples, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` can be accessed both on client components and server components by using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, but `SECRET_API_KEY` will only be available on server components by using `process.env.SECRET_API_KEY`.

> Do not forget to add the `/env` folder to the `.gitignore` file, since we don't want to push those files to our repo.

Now, go and install the `env-cmd` module by running `npm i env-cmd`. This module will allow us to pull the variables from our custom files and use them just like Next.js does.

Add the following script commands to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "development": "env-cmd -f ./env/.env.dev next dev",
    "staging": "env-cmd -f ./env/.env.stag next dev",
    "production": "env-cmd -f ./env/.env.prod next start"
  }
}
```

Now you are ready to go! Just remember to run:

- `npm run development` for running the dev app
- `npm run staging` for running the staging app
- `npm run production` for running the production app
